\section*{G. Cuckoo for Hashing}

This task describes a parameterised hashing algorithm and asks us to calculate
the final state of the hash tables after some series of element insertions,
given the parameters for the algorithm. There isn't much to this task. It
describes and algorithm and we are to implement it. Unfortunately, the
implementation details aren't particularly interesting either, though there is
a good deal of interesting theory underlying the hashing algorithm, but this is
outside the scope of the contest.

There are a couple different ways of implementing the hash function:
iteratively or recursively. The code should end up looking very similar and
take a very similar amount of time to write, but the recursive implementation
can sometimes be easier to think about (though your mileage may vary).

One minor annoyance, like in task C, is that if either table is empty, we
should not print out the header for that table. This isn't as fiddly as it
sounds, since we could just have flags that get set whenever we assign a value
to a table, but the naive method (which is implemented in the source) is to
just iterate through each table.
