\section*{H. Generation of Tribbles}

This task describes the Tribblenacci sequence, a sequence defined by a
recurrence relation with a very similar structure to the Fibonacci sequence.
The task asks us to calculate the g-th Tribblenacci value.

This is a very straightforward task if implemented recursively, the only
``trick'' involved being to remember to cache the values of Tribblenacci
numbers that have already been calculated, so as to avoid having an exponential
blowout in our recursion.

We could also have implemented this iteratively, which would mean that we do
not have to worry about caching values, since the iterative implementation is
more or less the recursive algorithm implemented bottom-up.

One potential bug would be using C ints to store the Tribblenacci values, since
these values can grow up to $7057305768232953720 \approx 7 \times 10^{18}$ (as
kindly presented in the sample data), and C ints can only hold up to 4 billion
or so if we're using unsigned ints (which we obviously can, since the sequence
is strictly increasing and starts of non-negative). A C unsigned long long can
hold up to $2^{64} \approx 18 \times 10^{18}$, and so these are sufficient.

This algorithm runs in $O(g)$.
