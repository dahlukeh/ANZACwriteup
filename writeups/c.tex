The task asks us to filter a list of alphanumeric strings for those that match
some ``scanned'' string. A scanned string is defined to be some
alphanumeric strings with certain characters replaced by asterisks, which act
as a wildcard character and will match on any character.

This problem is arguably the easiest task of the round in terms of thinking and
coding time (the other contender being task A). The most interesting part of
the task is detecting whether a string $s$ matches our scanned string $s'$. We
simply iterate through the characters, setting a flag to false if the character
in $s'$ is not an asterisk or equal to the corresponding character in $s$, as
per the definition of a scanned string.

One minor annoyance is the requirement to provide the number of matching
strings as the first line in the output, which prevents us from simply printing
out matching strings as we detect them. This can be done by marking strings as
matching, then printing them out after the count of the number of matching
strings found.

This algorithm runs in $O(n)$ time, given that the strings are all of a
constant length.
